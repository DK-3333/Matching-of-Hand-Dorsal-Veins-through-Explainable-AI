# Matching-of-Hand-Dorsal-Veins-through-Explainable-AI
Applied deep learning and computer vision with tools like YOLOv8 Nano, VoTT, and GradCAM to achieve explainable AI for matching hand dorsal veins.

1. Analyzed a dataset of over **11,043 RGB-colored dorsal palm images** using explainable AI techniques to build a biometric
authentication system with interpretable outputs.
2. Employed **VoTT (Visual Object Tagging Tool)** for manual bounding box annotation, enhancing feature detection accuracy
and model interpretability in the biometric system.
3. Leveraged the **YOLOv8 nano model** to achieve precise localization of dorsal palm images, attaining high accuracy **(99.9%
training, 95.3% validation)** through semantic and pixel-level segmentation technique.
